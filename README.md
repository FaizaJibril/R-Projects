<H1>Wind Speed</H1>

<h2>Project Goal</h2>
The goal is to develop machine learning and statistical models to predict wind speed and their impact on airport operations and identify the best performing model.
<h3>Tools used</h3>
1. R studio
2. Excel
<h3> Steps Taken</h3>
1. Define Problem Statement
2. Exploratory data analysis to understand the Data
3. Perform data preprocessing
4. Identify the type of statistical and Machine Learning models to be used for predicting the wind pattern

<h3>Results</h3>
Comparing the four models, the best model is the random forest model built with 250 trees. 
This model demonstrated the lowest RMSE values as demonstrated in figure 38, suggesting its 
superior accuracy in wind speed prediction. On the other hand, the ARIMA performed poorly 
for predicting wind speed. The regression line as seen in figure 39 supports the result that the 
model's predictions are in strong agreement with the actual values.
